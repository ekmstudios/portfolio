# Errol Mayer's portfolio website


Welcome!. I'm a native Chicagoan currently living in Austin, TX. I'm a technical writer by day and a programming hobbyist when it's not the work day. My professional interests include continuing to improve my technical writing skills, developing websites with PHP and React, developing IOS mobile apps with Swift and Android mobile apps with Kotlin, and cloud computing with AWS and Google Firebase. My personal hobbies include writing, reading, golfing, exercising, hiking, jogging, kayaking, traveling, volunteering, and photography.
